# Introduction: Importing Datasets

Objectives:

- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model development
- Model evaluation

will learn how to:

- Import data sets
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Manipulate pandas DataFrame
- Summarize data
- Build machine learning models using scikit-learn
- Build data pipelines

## Data Analysis

- helps us answer questions from data
- `Data Analysis` plays an important role in:
  - Discovering useful information
  - Answering questions
  - Predicting future of the unknown

## Data Analysis Libraries

1. Scientific Computing Libraries
    1. Pandas (Data structure and tools)
    2. NumPy (Arrays and matrices)
    3. SciPy (Integrals, solving differentials, equations, optimization)
2. Visualization Libraries
    1. Matplotlib (plot & graphs)
    2. Seaborn (plots: heat maps, time series, violin plots)
3. Algorithmic Libraries
    1. Scikit-learn (Machine learning: regression, classification, ... )
    2. Statsmodels (Explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests)

## Terms

- __Data acquisition__ is a process of loading and reading data into notebook from various sources.

## Actions performed at this step

1. [Loading data](./basics-1-importing-and-exporting-data.py)
2. [Understand data before begin any analysis. Gain basic insights from the data.](./basics-2-understanding-data.py)
   1. Data Types
      - potential info and type mismatch
      - compatibility with python methods
   2. Data Distribution
      - returns a statistical summary
3. Locate potential issues with the data
